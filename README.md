# Themis
Provides a python implementation of an algorithm that allows to produces samples from a fair coin given samples from a possibly biased coin.

Based on great writeup ["Tossing a Biased Coin" by Michael Mitzenmacher](http://www.eecs.harvard.edu/~michaelm/coinflipext.pdf)

Proof of optimality (statistical not computational):
[“Iterating von Neumann’s Procedure” by Yuval Peres, in The Annals of Statistics](https://projecteuclid.org/euclid.aos/1176348543)
